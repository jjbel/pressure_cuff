A device to apply and release pressure in a cuff wrapped around a limb, to ease pain.


### How existing digital blood pressure monitors work

Motor pump increases pressure in cuff

When pressure = blood pressure, blood flow stops => detected by microphone / stethoscope => used to know at what pressure to take systolic/diastolic reading.
This is not needed for our device

Has a separate sensor to continuously measure pressure, connected with a T junction between the pump and the cuff.

### Our Device

Only increases and decreases pressure cyclically

There are leaks etc, so motor needs to keep running to maintain pressure
Possibly use PID control

### Mitsumi R-14 A212: air pump

Currently unavailable :(

Can harvest existing BP devices for the pump

- Use processing, later use a display, and possibly a UI library
  either physics buttons or touchscreen

- Pressure relief valve with a solenoid
  Also one for user in emergency

- Powered by wall wart + rechargeable battery
  (newer arduinoâ€™s come with battery management system?)

- User interface: On, off, change program
  Program has ramp up time, max pressure steady time, ramp down time, no of cycles
